What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created in the repository. .git directory is the place where git maintains all the logs of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains all the files we want to add in a single commit. Working directory contains all the files which may or may not be commited. Repository 
contains all the commited files. It offers a way to add/update multiple files in a single commit.
